# MorseCodeRS
Arduino based morse code simultaneous sender and receiver.

Morse code was a primitive but revolutionary way used by the military in the late nineteenth century to exchange information. This communications language was originally a wired one-way signaling system between two devices, that is, if one device transmits then the other one can only receive; the two devices cannot transmit or receive at the same time. In this paper Arduino UNOs are employed to overcome this problem and add features like radio transmission, verification of delivery, ability to program different Morse code styles, integrated LCD display, real-time Morse code-to-letter translation and backspace function. The program created by our team and installed on the UNOs can convert Morse code into radio waves and backwards to provide a seamless communication experience.
